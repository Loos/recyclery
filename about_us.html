<h1>Our Mission</h1>
<p>The Recyclery Collective is an educational bike shop that promotes sustainability by giving access to tools, skills and opportunities for collaboration.</p>
<h1>Our Vision</h1>
<p>We envision a diverse, resilient neighborhood filled with knowledgeable, self-reliant cyclists.</p>
<h1>Our Values</h1>
<p><strong>Collaboration</strong>: We create opportunities for people of all backgrounds to work, share, and learn together to support a practical form of transportation. </p>
<p><strong>Social Justice</strong>: We provide tools and resources to empower underserved populations and nurture community leaders. </p>
<p><strong>Ecological Sustainability:</strong> We encourage  mindful use of resources and promote cycling as a part of building more resilient communities. </p>
<p>Celebration: We like to have fun while working hard to make bicycles and mechanics accessible. </p>
<h1>Our Structure</h1>
<p>The Recyclery is a 501c3 non-profit. All major decisions are made by a quorum of collective members at a twice-a-month meeting. Decisions are made by consensus and the collective is open to anyone willing to put in the time and effort to fulfill collective entry requirements. A few staff members are paid for administrative tasks, fixing bikes for sale, and teaching classes. Regular volunteers fix bikes that we give away and help during Open Shop.</p>
<h1>Our Support</h1>
<p>The Recyclery is grateful for all the support we receive from the wider community. We’d especially like to thank the Evanston Bicycle Club, Evanston Community Foundation, Reba Place Fellowship, and all of our bike-loving friends:</p>
